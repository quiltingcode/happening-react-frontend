# **Happening**

I live in a small town of around 15,000 people in the south of Spain, where lots of great events happen, but unlike in the big cities, there are no websites or applications dedicated to publicising the event information out to the people.

The most similar browser-based events platform that exists today would be Eventbrite. If I do a search in Eventbrite for events filtered by my town, the closest event is 100Km away. Even though I know there are lots of great events happening every day on my doorstep, there is no single application or website where I can see them. These days, people simply rely on diffusion via Whatsapp groups and posters in the streets. 

Happening provides an interactive platform to create, view, edit and delete event information for a local area. A user who wishes to share an event can upload information about the event, including the date, a description, a category for who it's ideally aimed at, an image or event poster, and keyword tags. A user who wishes to attend events can follow event hosts, show their interest in an event, mark as attending an event, comment on an event and write a review for an event. 

This fictional site was created for Portfolio Project #5 (Advanced Front End) - Diploma in Full Stack Software Development Diploma at the [Code Institute](https://www.codeinstitute.net).

# **Project**

## Objective

The objective of this project was to build a community-based content sharing web application for a small local area allowing users to learn about events happening in the area and to interact with the published content. The platform allows users to view, create, edit, delete, comment and review event postings. The content can be viewed in a logical order,  filtered by category, and searched on by keyword search. Users can also follow each other and register their interest in other users shared content. 

## Site User's Goal

There are primarily two types of users who will be interacting with this platform. Users who host events in the local area, and users who attend events in the local area. Of course there will also be some cross over between the two groups for those who post events but also attend them as well, which is highly likely being that it is to be used in a small town.
